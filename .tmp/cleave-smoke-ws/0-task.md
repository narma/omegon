# Task 0: report-only

## Root Directive

> Inspect the repository and report the current top-level files without making any edits. Do not modify files.

## Mission

Inspect the repository and report the current top-level files without making any edits.

## Scope

- `README.md`

**Depends on:** none (independent)



## Testing Requirements

### Test Convention

Write tests for new functions and changed behavior — co-locate as *.test.ts


## Contract

1. Only work on files within your scope
2. Follow the Testing Requirements section above
3. If the task is too complex, set status to NEEDS_DECOMPOSITION

## Finalization (REQUIRED before completion)

You MUST complete these steps before finishing:

1. Run all guardrail checks listed above and fix failures
2. Commit your in-scope work with a clean git state when you are done
3. Commit with a clear message: `git commit -m "feat(<label>): <summary>"`
4. Verify clean state: `git status` should show nothing to commit

Do NOT edit `.cleave-prompt.md` or any task/result metadata files. Those are orchestrator-owned and may be ignored by git.
Return your completion summary in your normal final response instead of modifying the prompt file.

> ⚠️ Uncommitted work will be lost. The orchestrator merges from your branch's commits.
