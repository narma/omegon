# Cleave

Task decomposition is provided by the **cleave extension** (`extensions/cleave/`).

## Tools & Commands

| Surface | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `cleave_assess` tool | Assess directive complexity → execute / cleave / needs_assessment |
| `cleave_run` tool | Execute a split plan with git worktree isolation |
| `/cleave <directive>` | Full interactive workflow: assess → plan → confirm → execute → report |

## Usage

```
/cleave "Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
```

The directive is assessed for complexity. If it exceeds the threshold (default 2.0),
it's decomposed into 2–4 child tasks executed in parallel via git worktrees.

## OpenSpec Integration

When `openspec/changes/*/tasks.md` exists in the repo, `/cleave` uses it as the
split plan instead of invoking the LLM planner:

1. Detects `openspec/` directory in the working tree
2. Finds changes with `tasks.md` files
3. Matches the directive to a change by name (slug matching)
4. Parses task groups → `ChildPlan[]` (skips all-done groups, caps at 4)
5. Infers dependencies from "after X" / "requires X" / "depends on X" markers
6. Falls back to LLM planner if no matching change is found

This makes OpenSpec the upstream planning layer and cleave the downstream
execution engine. OpenSpec is optional — cleave works standalone.

## Complexity Formula

```
complexity = (1 + systems) × (1 + 0.5 × modifiers)
effective  = complexity + 1  (when validation enabled)
```

## Architecture

```
extensions/cleave/
  index.ts        — Extension entry: registers tools + /cleave command
  assessment.ts   — Pattern library, complexity formula, fast-path triage
  planner.ts      — LLM prompt builder, JSON plan parser, wave computation
  openspec.ts     — OpenSpec tasks.md parser → ChildPlan[] conversion
  dispatcher.ts   — Child process dispatch, AsyncSemaphore, wave execution
  conflicts.ts    — 4-step conflict detection (file overlap, decision
                    contradiction, interface mismatch, assumption violation)
  workspace.ts    — Workspace management under ~/.pi/cleave/
  worktree.ts     — Git worktree create/merge/cleanup under ~/.pi/cleave/wt/
  types.ts        — Shared type definitions
```

## Workspace Layout

Workspaces and worktrees live outside the target repo:

```
~/.pi/cleave/
  <slug>/              — Workspace per run
    state.json         — Serialized CleaveState
    0-task.md          — Child task files
    1-task.md
  wt/                  — Git worktrees
    0-api-layer/       — Isolated working copy per child
    1-db-layer/
```

## State Machine

`ASSESS → PLAN → CONFIRM → DISPATCH → HARVEST → REUNIFY → REPORT → COMPLETE`

On merge failure, branches are preserved for manual resolution.
On success, worktrees and branches are cleaned up automatically.
